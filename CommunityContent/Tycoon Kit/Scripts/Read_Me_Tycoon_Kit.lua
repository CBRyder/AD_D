    So you have downloaded the tycoon kit and wish to know how to use it?
    Well here is how:
    The buy thing will aloow players to buy items assuming they have enough money
    Whenever you add a new buy thing increase the ID custom property by one
    the ID is what is saved and it handles saving and all that
    To create a new extractor use the stone spawner template and modify as you see fit
    To add a new ore/block use the stone example, change the model as you see fit but dont increase the cost on the folder, instead increase on the base block
    The pathway moves the blocks in the given vector on the custom property, if you wish to make your own pathway use the template and modify as see fit.

    If you wish to add save copy paste the code from this link into an empty script and drag it in.
